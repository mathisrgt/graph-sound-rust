# Graph Sound Rust 🚀🔊

A Rust project that generates data graphs and produces melodic sounds based on percentage variations.

## 📖 Introduction

This project uses Rust with and Rodio for sound generation and Actix Web to create a web server. It fetches percentage variation data from an external source (in this example, Bitcoin price data against the US dollar), generates melodic sounds based on these variations and displays it in the form of graphs.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 🦀
- [Cargo](https://crates.io/) 📦
- [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/) 🕸️
- [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/) 🧙
- [Rodio](https://crates.io/crates/rodio) 🎵
- [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) 🌐

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/mathisrgt/graph-sound-rust.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd graph-sound-rust`
3. Compile and run the project: `cargo run`

## 📚 Usage

- Listen to real-time sounds generated from the variations! 🔊
- Open your web browser and access `http://localhost:8080` to view the percentage variation graphs. 📊
