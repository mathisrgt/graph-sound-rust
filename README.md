# Graph Sound Rust 🚀🔊

A Rust project that generates data graphs and produces melodic sounds based on percentage variations.

## 📖 Introduction

This project uses Rust with Actix Web to create a web server, Tera for HTML templates, and Rodio for sound generation. It fetches percentage variation data from an external source (in this example, Bitcoin price data against the US dollar), displays it in the form of graphs, and generates melodic sounds based on these variations.

## 🚀 Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 🦀
- [Cargo](https://crates.io/) 📦
- [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/) 🕸️
- [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/) 🧙
- [Rodio](https://crates.io/crates/rodio) 🎵
- [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) 🌐

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-sound-rust.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd graph-sound-rust`
3. Compile and run the project: `cargo run`

## 📚 Usage

- Open your web browser and access `http://localhost:8080` to view the percentage variation graphs. 📊
- Listen to real-time sounds generated from the variations! 🔊
